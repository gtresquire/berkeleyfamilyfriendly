## Project 1 Proposal

### Parental Map Community

Team Members: Wassim, Amy, Aaron, Greg

### Project Description

We are creating a community database that displays information of places that have family-friendly features: drive-thrus, parking, baby-changing stations. In addition to showing a map of locations with these features, we will add a user-interface where users can input their own reviews/businesses/etc to our database. 

Problem we are addressing: 

Parents have a lack of time and information to efficiently/easily plan activities with their families. As such, we are giving parents access to information to facilitate their lives and overcome logistical obstacles. We are creating community database that displays an interactive map of places with family-friendly features: drive-thrus, parking, baby-changing stations. In addition to showing a map of curated locations with these features, we are creating a community-based platform where users can share their own locations/reviews to our database.

### Our Target Audience

We are trying to help busy parents who are looking for resources to streamline and organize  family activities. 

Our baseline goal is to have a map with a curated list of places that have certain family-friendly features. We also want to create an interactive platform where users may add additional locations and reviews to our existing library in real time. These features will be a resource to easily obtain information about local activities and places to help parents plan activities with their families. This will also unite the community by providing a space to share helpful information.

### Presentation Notes

Amy:  Present the problem from a parents point of view.  Follow up with mentioning the situations parents are in when the kids are sleeping in the car.  Personally I would drive up to 20 minutes out of the way to find a drive-thru, and I have done so, just to show up at a coffee shop without a drive-thru.  

Show a demo of searching for a drive thru search on google maps. 

When I search for drive thru food or drive thru coffee many business chains are tagged even when they are not a drive thru location. Wouldn’t it be nice to have an accurate filter? This is where ParentMaps comes in.  What other features do parents care about?  Opening story about a cafe here in Berkeley with the filthy bathroom and no baby changer.  I am on a road trip with 3 gas stations to choose from so I pick the biggest cleanest looking one expecting a nice bathroom with a changer.  Wouldn’t it be nice know where to go before parking and getting the little ones out of the carseats? Parent maps is here to help.  Reviews and information parents with young families need, without the rest. User verified, user populated data.  

Wassim: -General user demo.  Discussion ui/ux design, how layout supports functionality and purpose of the site.

Aaron:  Description of technology used and technical functionality.  

Greg:  Future features:

### Google API functions
   1. Geolocation, for mobile this would allow centering of the map based on user’s location.  

   2. Google Directions API;  Would allow for mapping from current location to target location (directions to a given pin)

   3. Custom Info Windows - Would show a popup info window when clicking or hovering over the pin.  Window could show business name and star rating system based on user input ratings.  Our map has default info windows from Google but these are only available if the location is already in Google’s default map database, and these only show the business or location name.

#

### Other features (not reliant on Google API)

Sorting by category is on our page, but not functioning yet.  

Log in to member portal for interaction between members, Users/member could communicate with each other to arrange play dates, meetups, and generally share info.  

We plan to populate 5 to 10 default pins for major markets.  We can also approach local businesses to sponsor adding their pin as a default.  The idea is that as users add pins the site will grow organically and the content will become more useful.  This site is easily scalable to any US cities, and possibly anywhere in the world.

## Conclusion

ParentMaps is a Disruptive/Game Changing application.  This site will motivate businesses to improve or add family friendly features so that their business is represented positively on the site.  Advertising and marketing opportunities will fit naturally within the site model to advertise products, services, and events catering to the needs of families.
